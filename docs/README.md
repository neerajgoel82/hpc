# Documentation

Cross-language documentation and learning resources for the HPC monorepo.

## Contents

This directory will contain:

- **getting-started.md** - First-time setup and environment configuration
- **learning-paths.md** - Recommended learning paths through the repository
- **conventions.md** - Coding standards and conventions across languages
- **migration-notes.md** - Notes on how this monorepo was assembled
- **resources.md** - External learning resources and references

## Purpose

While each language directory has its own README and documentation, this `docs/` directory contains:

1. **Cross-language guidance** - Information relevant to multiple languages
2. **Repository structure** - How to navigate the monorepo
3. **Learning strategies** - How to approach HPC learning
4. **Comparisons** - Performance and implementation comparisons across languages
