 * TRY THIS:
 * 1. Create inline functions for min() and max()
2. Compare performance of inline vs non-inline (compile with -O0)
3. Create a class with inline getters/setters
4. Why would a recursive function be a poor inline candidate?
5. Create inline vector math functions (add, subtract, multiply)
