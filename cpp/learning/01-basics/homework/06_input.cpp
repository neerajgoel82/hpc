/*
 * TRY THIS:
 * 1. Create a program that asks for temperature in Celsius and converts to Fahrenheit
2. Read 3 numbers and find the largest
3. Ask for user's birth year and calculate their age
4. Create a guessing game (program picks random number, user guesses)
5. Handle invalid input gracefully (what if user enters letters instead of numbers?)

EXAMPLE RUN:
