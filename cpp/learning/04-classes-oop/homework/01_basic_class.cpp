/*
 * Homework: 01_basic_class.cpp
 *
 * Complete the exercises below based on the concepts from 01_basic_class.cpp
 * in the classwork folder.
 *
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Read the corresponding classwork file first
 * 2. Implement the solutions below
 * 3. Compile: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra 01_basic_class.cpp -o homework
 * 4. Test your solutions
 */

#include <iostream>

/*
 * TRY THIS:
 * * 1. Add a normalize() method to Vec3 that makes the vector unit length
 * 2. Add a constructor to Particle that takes initial velocity
 * 3. Create a dotProduct() method that takes another Vec3 as parameter
 * 4. Add a static member variable to Particle to count total particles
 * 5. Create a BoundingBox class with min and max Vec3 points
 *
 * COMMON MISTAKES:
 * - Forgetting to initialize member variables in constructors
 * - Not marking methods const when they should be
 * - Trying to access private members from outside the class
 * - Not understanding when constructors/destructors are called
 *
 * GPU CONNECTION:
 * - In CUDA/GPU code, simple classes like Vec3 work on device
 * - Complex classes with dynamic memory need special handling
 * - Understanding object lifecycle prevents memory leaks on GPU
 * - Constructor/destructor patterns help with resource management
