/*
 * Homework: 01_operator_overloading.cpp
 *
 * Complete the exercises below based on the concepts from 01_operator_overloading.cpp
 * in the classwork folder.
 *
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Read the corresponding classwork file first
 * 2. Implement the solutions below
 * 3. Compile: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra 01_operator_overloading.cpp -o homework
 * 4. Test your solutions
 */

#include <iostream>

/*
 * TRY THIS:
 * * 1. Add [] operator for Vec3 (access x, y, z by index)
 * 2. Implement Vec4 with w component for homogeneous coordinates
 * 3. Add lerp operator or function: Color::lerp(other, t)
 * 4. Implement dot product as operator* (or keep as method?)
 * 5. Add Color blending modes (multiply, screen, overlay)
 * 6. Implement 2D Point class with distance operator
 *
 * COMMON MISTAKES:
 * - Forgetting const for read-only operators
 * - Wrong return type (reference vs value)
 * - Not implementing both a+b and a+=b consistently
 * - Forgetting non-member operator for commutative operations
 *
 * GPU CONNECTION:
 * - Vector math is fundamental to all GPU programming
 * - Shader code uses vector operators extensively
 * - Transform calculations: position, rotation, scale
 * - Physics: forces, velocities, accelerations
 * - Graphics: colors, lighting, blending
 *
 * BEST PRACTICES:
 * - Implement related operators together (+, +=)
 * - Use const references for parameters
 * - Make operators const when possible
 * - Implement operator<< for debugging
 * - Consider performance (return value optimization)
