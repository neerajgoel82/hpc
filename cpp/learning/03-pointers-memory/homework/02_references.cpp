 * TRY THIS:
 * 1. Create a function that increments a value using reference
2. What happens if you try: int& ref; (without initialization)?
3. Create a function that returns largest element by reference
4. Compare performance: pass large struct by value vs const reference
5. Can you create a reference to a reference?
