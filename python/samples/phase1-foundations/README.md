# Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-3)

Welcome to Python! This phase covers the fundamentals you'll use in every program you write.

## What You'll Learn

- Python syntax and basic operations
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Core data structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1: Getting Started
- `01_hello_world.py` - Your first Python program
- `02_variables_types.py` - Variables and data types
- `03_operators.py` - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
- `04_input_output.py` - User input and output
- `05_string_basics.py` - Working with strings
- **Project:** `project_calculator.py` - Simple calculator

### Week 2: Control Flow
- `06_conditionals.py` - If/elif/else statements
- `07_while_loops.py` - While loops
- `08_for_loops.py` - For loops
- `09_loop_control.py` - Break, continue, pass
- `10_string_formatting.py` - F-strings and formatting
- **Project:** `project_guessing_game.py` - Number guessing game

### Week 3: Data Structures
- `11_lists.py` - Lists and list methods
- `12_tuples.py` - Tuples
- `13_dictionaries.py` - Dictionaries
- `14_sets.py` - Sets and set operations
- `15_list_comprehensions.py` - List comprehensions
- **Project:** `project_contact_book.py` - Contact management system

## How to Proceed

1. Start with `01_hello_world.py`
2. Read the instructions in each file
3. Complete the exercises (marked with TODO)
4. Run the file to test: `python3 filename.py`
5. Move to the next file when you understand the concept

## Testing Your Knowledge

At the end of each week, complete the project. This solidifies what you've learned.

Let's begin! Open `01_hello_world.py` now.
