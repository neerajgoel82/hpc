"""
Week 1 Project: Simple Calculator

Create a calculator that:
1. Shows a welcome message
2. Displays a menu of operations
3. Gets two numbers from user
4. Performs the selected operation
5. Displays the result formatted nicely

This project combines everything from Week 1:
- Variables and data types
- Operators
- User input/output
- String formatting
"""

# TODO: Print a welcome message and program title
# Make it look nice with some formatting


# TODO: Display the menu
# 1. Addition
# 2. Subtraction
# 3. Multiplication
# 4. Division
# 5. Floor Division
# 6. Modulus (Remainder)
# 7. Exponentiation (Power)


# TODO: Get the operation choice from user (1-7)
# Convert to integer


# TODO: Get two numbers from user
# Convert to float (to handle decimals)


# TODO: Perform the calculation based on choice
# For now, use if-elif structure (we'll learn this next week)
# Or simply do one operation as practice

# Example structure (you'll learn if statements in Week 2):
# if choice == 1:
#     result = num1 + num2
#     operation = "+"
# elif choice == 2:
#     result = num1 - num2
#     operation = "-"
# ... and so on


# TODO: Display the result in a formatted way
# Example output:
# ================================
#   25.0 + 17.5 = 42.5
# ================================


# BONUS CHALLENGES:
# 1. Add input validation (check if numbers are valid)
# 2. Handle division by zero
# 3. Show the calculation with 2 decimal places
# 4. Add more operations (square root, percentage, etc.)
# 5. Let user do multiple calculations (hint: use a loop - Week 2 topic)
# 6. Create a receipt-style output
