2. **Complete exercises in order** - Each builds on previous knowledge
3. **Type all code yourself** - No copy-pasting!
4. **Run and test everything** - Make sure you understand the output
5. **Experiment** - Modify the code, break it, fix it
6. **Check solutions only after trying** - Solutions are in `_solutions/` folders
