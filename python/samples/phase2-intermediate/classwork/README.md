# Phase 6: PyTorch Deep Learning - Classwork

This directory contains Python learning examples with complete explanations and demonstrations.

## What's in Classwork?

Classwork files are **teaching materials** that:
- Explain Python concepts with detailed comments
- Show working examples and best practices
- Demonstrate Pythonic patterns
- Include exercises (TODO) to practice

## How to Use

### 1. Read the Code
Open each .py file and read through the code and comments carefully.

### 2. Run the Programs
```bash
# From this directory:
python3 01_hello_world.py    # Run specific program
```

### 3. Experiment
Modify the code to test your understanding. Try:
- Changing values and observing results
- Adding print statements to trace execution
- Testing edge cases
- Breaking things to understand error messages

### 4. Move to Homework
Once you understand the concepts, go to ../homework/ to practice.

## Running Programs

```bash
# Run a single program
python3 01_hello_world.py

# Run with Python interpreter
python3 -i 01_hello_world.py    # Interactive mode

# Check syntax
python3 -m py_compile 01_hello_world.py
```

## Python Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use type hints (phase 3+)
- Handle exceptions appropriately

## Files in This Directory

Each .py file focuses on specific Python concepts. Work through them in numerical order for the best learning experience.

## Tips for Learning

- **Type the code**: Don't just read - type examples yourself
- **Use REPL**: Test snippets in Python interactive shell
- **Read errors**: Python error messages are helpful
- **Use print()**: Debug by printing values
- **Experiment**: Try variations of the code

## Next Steps

After studying classwork:
1. Review the TODO sections
2. Go to ../homework/ directory
3. Implement the exercises
4. Test and debug your solutions

## Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
