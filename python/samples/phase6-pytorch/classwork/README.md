# Classwork – Reference Programs

This folder contains the **reference / in-class** Python programs for this phase. Use them while working on the matching exercises in `../homework/`.

## Run programs

From this directory:

```bash
make run       # Run all .py in this directory
make run-all   # Run all .py (including subdirs, if any)
make list      # List Python files here
make clean     # Remove __pycache__ and .pyc
make help      # Show Makefile targets
```

From the phase directory:

```bash
make classwork   # Run all classwork (phase Makefile)
```

## Run a single file

```bash
python3 01_hello_world.py
python3 02_variables_types.py
# etc.
```

## Files

Each `.py` file is a standalone script. See the phase `README.md` for the topic list.
