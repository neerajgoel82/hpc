 * EXERCISES:
 * * 1. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle (area = π * r²)
 * 2. Calculate compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^t
 * 3. Swap two numbers using arithmetic operators (without a temp variable)
 * 4. Check if a number is even or odd using the modulus operator
 * 5. Experiment with operator precedence: what is the result of 2 + 3 * 4?
